Find example Python program for getting crypto data through an API. DONE
  -I have found an excellent Python template from https://github.com/huwwp/cryptop which uses an API from cryptocompare.com
Use Yfinance API to get stock data 
Will potentially use this as a python template https://github.com/JordanDotT/StockInfo
