Find example Python program for getting crypto data through an API. DONE
  -I have found an excellent Python template from https://github.com/huwwp/cryptop which uses an API from cryptocompare.com
Use Yfinance API to get stock data
Will potentially use this as a python template https://github.com/JordanDotT/StockInfo 

YFinance API will need 3 mandatory arguments in this order:
(1)Tickers 
(2)Start date + End date or Period 
(3)Interval 

Added the top ten bitcoin prices that can be used to see the trend for data analysis.

# Build a crypto currency portfolio App with Python
The roadmap will be to build a python App that goes and looks up current priceses of different cryptocurrencies and then output the results on the screen.

We will do it in a couple of difference ways:
(1) From the command line by just using straightup python code
(2) Build a GUI Desktop App
